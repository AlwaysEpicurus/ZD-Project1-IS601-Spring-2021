# Continous Integration
## _How does it improve a companies productvity and competitiveness?_

Continuous Integration improves productivity and competitiveness by increasing the speed at which quality code allows teams to focus on innovating instead of engaging in manual and repetitive tasks. Automating the commit-build-test-deploy process diminishes arduous, monotonous, and everyday activities programmers face. CI helps teams use data to track performance, transparency to improve communication, and Automated testing to rapidly deploy quality code. CI instills a repeatable process that allows the development team to improve the software based on the user changing needs. They are focused proactively on improving the software instead of reacting to buggy code and maintaining the process itself.
