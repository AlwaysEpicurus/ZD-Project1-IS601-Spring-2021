# Status

## Definition

* The Status command tells you what branch you are on, any changes or additions in staging, and any untracked files.
 
* It is often within an action process to ensure proper setup before committing or finalizing the action process.

* Untracked files could include files you have not yet commited but also other files, which you can have Status ignore by using a .gitignore file.


## Examples 

Get Status
```
git status
```
