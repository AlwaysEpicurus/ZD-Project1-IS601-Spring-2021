# Fork

## Definition

* To Fork is to copy any public repository and add it as a repository under your account.

* You can then use, add to or change the storage contents (per the contrasts of the license). 

* You can also submit any changes or added back to the original repository if that repository accepts changes. 

* Often forking is used in the development team when a team lead wants to prevent a junior or outsourced developer from merging code to the repository. In a sense, it provides an extra layer to project the origin repository.
