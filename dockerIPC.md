## Improve Productivity
* Easy to use 
    * Docker has plenty of resources to learn from in order to create and manage containers [1]
    * Since it is open-source, all that is needed is an operating system that supports Virtualbox, Docker for Mac/Windows, or Linux [1]
* Docker is flexible
    * The use of container orchestrators helps in the management of running and monitoring of many containers [1]
    * Less time is spent on managing all containers, and more focus is put on the development of the application 
    * Allows developers to run any linux-based operating system within the container. So, one application can use one linux-bas OS, while another application can use an entirely different one [3]
* No need to worry about the system
    * Developers can focus on writing code and development, and not have to worry about whether or not the system will be able to handle it all [2]


## Improve Competitiveness
* Less time training employees
    * Due to numerous training resources available on the internet, less time and resources need to be spent 
* Portability is key
    * Software delivery using containers can be more efficient, as containers are portable [1]
    * Software dependencies come along with the container, and if a container works on one machine, it will run the exact same way in different environments [1]
    * Eliminates configurations issues during deployment [1]
* Faster Scalability
    * Cuts costs due to containers using less computing power while doing more work [1]
    * Shared hardware = lower costs
    * Savings can then be used to better their products [1]
