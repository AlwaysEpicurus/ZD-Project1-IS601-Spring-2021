# Remote Add/Remove/Show
## Definition 

* The Remote Add command allows you to add a connection to a repository.

* You can give that connection handle to refer to it, so you donâ€™t have to type the URL each time.

* You can remove a connection to a remote connection with the "Remove Remove"

* You can get detailed information, including tracked and new branches, by using the "Remote Show." 

## Examples
