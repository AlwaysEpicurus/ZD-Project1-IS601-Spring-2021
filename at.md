#Automation Testing
##_How does this make a company competitive and productive?_

Automation Testing improves productivity and competitiveness by increasing speed, improving quality, and possibly decreasing software development costs. Automation Testing utilized software programs to conduct testing on newly written software that humans would otherwise do. Automation Testing eliminates laborious, repetitive, and menial tasks for programers, freeing up their time, and reduces mental fatigue. Automation Tests can be set up within a workflow, run without supervision, and produce test reporting. Although Automation Testing can be expensive to implement, ROI companies can realize reduced software failures and payroll costs.
