# Git

## Improve Productivity
* Provides a company a basic workflow [1]
    * Employees can clone the central repository and begin work on their local copy
    * There is no time wasted collecting all of the necessary files together, and the potential of losing files is minimal with the central repository
    * Once an employee is ready to commit their changes, they can then apply it to the central repository
* Feature branch for main code
    * Branches allow for employees to work on pieces of code without affecting the main code directly
    * The feature branch allows for two or more employees to work on different features separately [1]
    * They can then merge their work together into the main branch independently from any branch without potentially ruining the code [1]
* Version Control
    * Without Git, it is not necessarily easy to return to a stable version of the code if issues occur
    * Addtionally, if there is no stable version of the code to return to, more time will be spent retyping the code out than spent on fixing bugs
    * With Git, if an issue occurs with the code, it is easy to return to a stable version of the code with a few simple commands
    * Now, more time is spent on working on the project, rather than restarting completely
* Better Communication
    * With Git and GitHub, employees can comment on what has been done with the project, and can help identify issues that need fixed or code that may need more added to it [2]
    * Employees can be assigned multiple assignments at once, which can save time and increase efficiency when each employees knows what to work on ahead of time [2]
    * Task lists can be used in order to break down larger issues into stages. This prevents the creation of a multitude of smaller issuses, which should help in keeping all work in one place [2] 
    * Milestones keep employees focused on the tasks at hands by associating tasks with a deadline [2]
    * Project boards allows employees a nice interface to see what is being worked on, and gives a good overview of the whole project [2]

## Improve Competitiveness
* Less time spent wrangling files together
    * More time spent fixing bugs and issues with the code
    * End result is a better product with minimal bugs and issues
* Minimal chance of running into issues with conflicting versions of code
    * Less time potentially fixing any issues with the versioning of code
    * More time and resources spent on bettering the product
* Hardly any need for extensive training in Git and GitHub
    * Plenty of training and helpful resources for users to learn from
    * Easy to learn for new users, which saves the company money 
    * Allows the users to start almost immediately, which saves time and resources
